üìù Synergy: Pomodoro & To-Do App

Synergy is an all-in-one desktop productivity tool designed to help you manage your tasks effectively and stay focused using the Pomodoro Technique. It seamlessly integrates your to-do lists with a Pomodoro timer, providing a streamlined experience for planning and executing your work.

‚ú® Features
Integrated To-Do List:

Create, view, and manage your daily tasks.

Add details and notes to each task.

Mark tasks as complete.

Prioritize tasks to focus on what matters most.

Pomodoro Timer:

Start, pause, and reset customizable Pomodoro sessions (default: 25 minutes work, 5 minutes short break, 15-30 minutes long break after 4 Pomodoros).

Associate a Pomodoro session directly with a specific task from your to-do list.

Notifications for the end of a work session or break.

Progress Tracking:

See how many Pomodoros you've completed for each task.

Gain insights into your work habits and time spent on different activities.

User-Friendly Interface:

Clean and intuitive design for ease of use.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js (for potential future enhancements like data persistence or user accounts, though initial version may be client-side focused)

üöÄ Installation
To get a copy of this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
You need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

Node.js: Download & Install Node.js (npm is included with Node.js)

Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Cynthia-Motaung/synergy.git
cd productivity-hub

Install Dependencies
If the project uses any Node.js packages (e.g., for a simple local server or future data handling), run:

npm install

Run the Application
Since this is primarily a client-side application with Node.js for potential backend features, you might simply open the index.html file in your browser.

If a local server is set up (e.g., using http-server or a custom Node.js script):

# Example if using 'http-server' for local development
npm install -g http-server
http-server .

Then, open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 (or whatever port is indicated).

üí° Usage
Add Tasks: Use the input field to add new tasks to your to-do list.

Start a Pomodoro: Click on a task to select it, then click the "Start Pomodoro" button to begin a focused work session.

Take Breaks: The app will notify you when it's time for a short break or a longer break after multiple Pomodoros.

Track Progress: Observe the visual indicators for completed Pomodoros and tasks.

üîÆ Future Enhancements
We have several ideas for enhancing Productivity Hub to make it even more powerful:

User Accounts & Data Persistence: Implement a Node.js backend with a database (PostgreSql) to allow users to create accounts, save their tasks and Pomodoro history, and access them across different devices.

Advanced Reporting: Develop more detailed charts and statistics to visualize productivity trends, such as daily/weekly focus time, task completion rates, and Pomodoro distribution.

Integrations: Explore integrations with calendar applications (Google Calendar, Outlook Calendar) to automatically pull in scheduled tasks or block out focus time.

Customizable Themes & Sounds: Allow users to personalize the app's appearance with different themes and choose from various notification sounds.

Desktop Notifications (Native): Enhance notifications for a more seamless experience, even when the app is in the background.

Gamification: Introduce elements like streaks, badges, or points to encourage consistent use and productivity.

Collaboration Features: Enable sharing of task lists and Pomodoro sessions with other users for team-based work or accountability partners.
